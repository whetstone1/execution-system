  parent: [
    { q: "How is this different from an ADHD coach?", a: "Most ADHD coaches focus on one lever: training your child to build better habits. That's necessary, but often insufficient. The Execution System also installs environment design (changing what surrounds your child) and external accountability infrastructure (daily EA calls, weekly coaching). We diagnose which levers are missing and install all of them — not just the one most coaches rely on." },
    { q: "Does this replace therapy?", a: "No. We sit underneath therapy, tutoring, and productivity tools — we make them work. If your child is in therapy for anxiety, we ensure the structural breakdowns that feed that anxiety (missed deadlines, chaotic mornings, chronic overcommitment) are addressed. We don't do emotional processing. We do execution infrastructure." },
    { q: "What if my child refuses to participate?", a: "This is a real risk, and we screen for it. During the diagnostic call, we assess whether your child has minimum buy-in — they don't need to be enthusiastic, but they need to not be actively hostile. If the fit isn't right, we'll tell you. We'd rather turn away a client than take money for a system that can't work." },
    { q: "What does the Executive Assistant actually do?", a: "Your child's EA conducts a 10-minute daily planning call: reviewing today's calendar, confirming start times for key tasks, identifying friction points, and logging completion from yesterday. They also send reminders, remove logistical friction (booking study rooms, printing materials), and feed data to the weekly coach. Think of them as the scaffolding that makes the calendar real." },
    { q: "What happens over summer or school breaks?", a: "The system adapts. Summer structure looks different — fewer academic commitments, more project and habit goals — but the accountability architecture stays. Many families find summer is when the system is most valuable, because the external structure school provides disappears." },
    { q: "How long do clients typically stay?", a: "The minimum commitment for Tier 2 is three months. Most families stay 6–12 months. The goal is to build enough internal capacity and environmental design that the accountability layer becomes less necessary. We want to make ourselves obsolete." }

    { q: "How is this different from an ADHD coach?", a: "Most coaches focus on one lever: training you to build better habits. That's necessary but often insufficient. The Execution System also installs environment design (changing what's around you) and external accountability (daily EA calls, weekly coaching). We diagnose which levers are missing and install all of them." },
    { q: "Does this replace therapy?", a: "No. We sit underneath therapy, tutoring, and productivity tools — we make them work. If you're dealing with anxiety, we address the structural breakdowns that feed it: missed deadlines, chaotic mornings, chronic overcommitment. We don't do emotional processing. We do execution infrastructure." },
    { q: "This sounds like someone micromanaging me.", a: "It's the opposite. Right now, someone is already managing you — your parents, your anxiety, your last-minute panic. The system replaces that with a professional structure you control. You set the goals. The EA helps you execute them. The coach helps you learn from what breaks. The goal is to build your capacity until you don't need us." },
    { q: "What does the Executive Assistant actually do?", a: "A 10-minute daily call: review today's calendar, confirm start times, identify friction points, log what you completed yesterday. They also send reminders and handle logistics. Think of them as the scaffolding that makes your calendar real — not someone checking up on you, but someone holding the structure so you can focus on the work." },
    { q: "How long do people typically stay?", a: "Minimum commitment is three months for Tier 2. Most people stay 6–12 months. The goal is to build enough internal capacity and environmental design that the accountability layer becomes less necessary. We want to make ourselves obsolete." }

All helped with symptoms but nothing addressed the daily execution gap. Within three weeks of the system, task initiation improved markedly. The daily EA calls were the primary driver — homework started before parents asked.", outcome: "Task initiation moved from 2/10 to 7/10 in six weeks" },
  { label: "Composite scenario based on multiple Tier 2 clients", summary: "College sophomore, engineering major. No clinical diagnosis — just chronic procrastination and a widening gap between capability and output. The weekly coach identified a pattern: every missed deadline traced back to the same failure mode (overcommitment without time-awareness). After recalibrating load and installing daily planning calls, completion rate climbed from roughly 40% to 85% of weekly commitments.", outcome: "Commitment completion rate: ~40% → 85% in two months" },
  { label: "Composite scenario based on multiple parent experiences", summary: "Parent of 10th grader. The biggest shift wasn't academic — it was relational. Monthly reports replaced the daily cycle of texting, reminding, and arguing about assignments. The parent went from functioning as the accountability system to simply reading a PDF. Student's execution improved. The relationship improved more.", outcome: "Parent-student conflict reduced substantially; GPA up 0.6 points" }

              <p className="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed text-sm mb-4" style={{ fontFamily: sans }}>Cole studied classics at Harvard and did graduate work in philosophy at Oxford, where he taught Ancient Greek at Jesus College and Harris Manchester College. He runs Whetstone Admissions and co-founded the New York Philosophical Society, where he leads Philosophy Club — a weekly program serving 600+ participants with a waitlist of over 3,000.</p>
